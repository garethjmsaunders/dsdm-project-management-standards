## 1. Introduction

The responsitory contains the standard template documents used by the digital communications team at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) in controlling DSDM agile projects.

These documents are based on standard templates that were donated by [RADTAC](https://www.radtac.com/) under license to the DSDM Consortium, now [Agile Business Consortium](https://www.agilebusiness.org/content/foreword-0). They were adapted by the digital communications team for use on the external website programme. A lot of descriptive text used within the documents has been taken from the DSDM Atern handbook 2008.

Document numbering used in the lists below is based on those used in [Appendix C](https://www.agilebusiness.org/content/appendix-c-products-detail) of the DSDM Atern handbook 2008.
